# Responsive Catalog-Based Website for a Textile Business

Excited to share a project I just completed for a professional textile business in the city! ðŸŽ‰

I built a catalog-based website that's fully responsive and super user-friendly.

Key Features
1.Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience on any device, whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
2.Dynamic Specification Management: The owner can easily add or remove specifications just by updating a single array.
3.Flexible Variant Handling: Automatically adjusts to any number of variants for each image, making it super flexible and efficient.
